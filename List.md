### Identifying the context of mutations in a cancer genome
Exploring the genomic context of cancer-causing mutations and using that to differentiate between driver and passenger mutations is not very well 
explored. In this study, we use both publicly available cancer mutation data from the [COSMIC v90](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) and
WGS data from isogenic mice models affected with PDAC to extract sequence-based features from the neighbourhood of a mutation. 
Our goal is to develop novel algorithms that apply methods from Natural Language Processing and machine learning to analyse the sequence and positional 
context of genomic mutations to distinguish between driver and passengers.
